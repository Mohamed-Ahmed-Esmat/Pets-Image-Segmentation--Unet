# Pets-Image-Segmentation--Unet
This repository contains an implementation of the **U-Net** architecture for image segmentation tasks using the **Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset**. U-Net is commonly used in image segmentation applications, such as medical imaging and object boundary detection. The dataset contains images of pets with corresponding masks that include class labels.
